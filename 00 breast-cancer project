Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast 
shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant 
spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.
Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcoholism, hormone replacement 
therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, an early age at first menstruation, having children late in life or not at all, older age, 
having a prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer. About 5–10% of cases are the result of a genetic 
predisposition inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells 
from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply these ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as 
ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. There are more than 18 other sub-types of breast 
cancer. Some, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking 
a biopsy of the concerning tissue. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the 
breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective.

In this project, I tried to predict the breasr cancer diagnosis with Support Vector Machine. I also tried to modify the algorithm to 
attain much better prediction results.
